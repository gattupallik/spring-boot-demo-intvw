****************8CI/CD Pipeline Setup for Spring Boot Application*******************

This README provides a comprehensive guide to setting up a CI/CD pipeline for a Spring Boot "Hello World" application using GitHub Actions and deploying it to an AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster. The pipeline includes building the application, creating a Docker image, pushing it to Docker Hub, and deploying the image to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

AWS Account: An active AWS account to create and manage resources on EKS.

Docker Hub Account: An account on Docker Hub to store and manage your Docker images.

AWS CLI: Installed and configured AWS CLI to manage AWS services from the command line.

kubectl: Installed kubectl command-line tool for Kubernetes management.

Helm: Installed Helm, the Kubernetes package manager.

GitHub Repository: A GitHub repository for your Spring Boot application.

GitHub Secrets: Set up the following GitHub Secrets in your repository:

DOCKER_USERNAME: Your Docker Hub username.

DOCKER_PASSWORD: Your Docker Hub password.

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: Your AWS access key ID.

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Your AWS secret access key.

Step-by-Step Guide
Clone the Repository

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory.

Spring Boot Application

Ensure you have a Spring Boot "Hello World" application in your repository. If not, you can create one using Spring Initializr or use an existing public Spring Boot project.

Create a Dockerfile

Add a Dockerfile to the root of your project to define the Docker image for the Spring Boot application.

Create Kubernetes Manifests

Create a k8s directory and add your deployment and service YAML files for Kubernetes.

Create Helm Chart

Create a Helm chart for deploying the Docker image to the Kubernetes cluster.

Create GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a .github/workflows/main.yml file to define the GitHub Actions workflow for building the application, creating a Docker image, pushing it to Docker Hub, and deploying it to EKS using Helm.

Commit and Push Your Changes

Add, commit, and push your changes to the GitHub repository to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow.

Monitor the Deployment

Go to the Actions tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the progress of the workflow and ensure that the deployment is successful.

By following these steps, you will have a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that builds, dockerizes, and deploys your Spring Boot application to an AWS EKS cluster using Helm. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to reach out! ðŸ˜Š
